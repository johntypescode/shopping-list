# Shopping List Application
Shopping list app powered by vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Summary
This application was developed using barebones HTML, CSS and JavaScript; no frameworks or external 
libraries have been employed. While I am certainly no stranger to JavaScript and programming syntax in 
general, it has been years since I've done anything productive with JavaScript. That being said, this 
project aims to serve as a refresher for me -- so much has changed since I was last "active" within 
the JavaScript community.
